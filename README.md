# State-Driven Account Onboarding (Spring Boot 3.3, Java 21)

This project implements a **state-driven account onboarding system** using **Spring Boot 3.3**, **Java 21**, and **Spring State Machine**.
It supports multiple onboarding flows, each with its own business logic and transitions, and persists process state in a MongoDB-backed repository.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

1. **Multiple Process Types**

   * **SINGLE\_OWNER** ‚Äì Single account holder onboarding
   * **MULTI\_OWNER** ‚Äì Multiple owners with coordination step
   * **MINOR** ‚Äì Minor account creation with parent consent
   * **MINOR\_TO\_REGULAR** ‚Äì Conversion from minor to regular account

2. **Event-Driven State Transitions**

   * State changes are triggered by domain events (`ProcessEvent`).
   * State machine configuration defines allowed transitions and guards.
   * Supports validation and additional variable storage during events.

3. **Persistent State Machine**

   * Process state is stored in MongoDB via `ProcessInstanceRepository`.
   * Variables are merged and updated on each event.
   * Allows pausing and resuming flows.

4. **Extensible**

   * Adding new process types or states requires minimal configuration changes.
   * Designed for clean separation between service logic, state machine config, and persistence.

# Choosing Between `/event` and `/advance`

## TL;DR

* Use **`/process/{id}/event`** when the **client knows the exact event** to fire (fine-grained control).
* Use **`/process/{id}/advance`** when the **server should decide the next event** from the current state & type (simpler client, server-driven flow).

## When to use which

| Scenario                                                 | Use        | Why                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Front-end wizard is tightly coupled to domain events     | `/event`   | Client explicitly picks the event and payload for each step           |
| ‚ÄúJust go to the next step‚Äù UX                            | `/advance` | Server maps `(type,state) ‚Üí event`, checks preconditions, transitions |
| You need strict API compatibility with legacy clients    | `/event`   | No hidden server logic; clients send explicit events                  |
| You want to minimize front-end knowledge of the workflow | `/advance` | Server owns the progression rules, less client logic                  |
